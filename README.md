# Clientpanel

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.
this project is a basic authentication and CRUD implementation. This project was build to better understand Angular and NoSQL database. For this I used Angular 6 and Google Firestore as a backend. This project may be expanded upon in the future to test new Firestore features
